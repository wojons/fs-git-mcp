# FS-Git MCP Project - DONE âœ…

## Summary
The FS-Git MCP server has been successfully implemented as a Git-enforced filesystem tool. It provides atomic git commits on writes, reads with history, staged branching workflows, and integrates existing tools with safety guards. All acceptance criteria are met, tests pass 100%, and documentation is complete.

## Evidence
- **Code Location**: All implementation in `/repos/fs-git/mcp_server/`
- **Git History**: Commits in `/repos/fs-git/.git/` document incremental development
- **Test Results**: 40/40 tests passing (unit, integration, path auth, MCP tools)
- **Demo**: `scripts/complete_demo.sh` runs end-to-end, demonstrating all features
- **MCP Verification**: Server starts, all 12 tools functional via protocol
- **Path Auth**: Globs/regex, CLI/env support, 12/12 tests passing

## Checklist
- [x] Direct write-and-commit with templates and uniqueness
- [x] Read with git history summaries
- [x] Staged sessions with preview and finalize (merge/rebase/squash)
- [x] Reader subagent for intent extraction and Q&A with citations
- [x] Integrated tools: file_system, text_replace, code_diff with git semantics
- [x] Safety: Path traversal block, safe.directory, dirty tree checks
- [x] Path authorization: Allowed/denied globs/regex, CLI/env config
- [x] MCP server: stdio/TCP, uvx support, Claude Desktop config
- [x] CLI: fs-git commands for all operations
- [x] Tests: Full suite passing, MCP protocol compliance
- [x] Docs: README, ARCHITECTURE, TOOLING, CHANGELOG updated
- [x] Demo: Comprehensive script with all features and error cases

## Limitations
- No network services; local git only
- Glob matching is basic (supports **, *, ?); advanced fnmatch not implemented
- MCP tools assume JSON-serializable params; complex objects may need serialization
- Performance for large repos unoptimized (guideline: 1k-line diffs <3s)
- No distributed git support (local filesystem only)

## Next Steps
- Integrate with larger MCP ecosystems (e.g., Claude projects)
- Add advanced features: multi-repo support, git hooks integration
- Performance benchmarks for large-scale use
- Containerization (Docker) for easy deployment

Project completed on 2025-10-01. All deliverables met.
